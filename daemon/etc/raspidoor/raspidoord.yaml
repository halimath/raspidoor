# This is the default configuration for raspidoord. It defines the standard layout of the GPIO pins but the
# SIP configuration is expected not to work.
#
# To override any of the values defined here, create a file in /etc/raspidoor/conf.d/raspidoord.yaml and set
# the respective values.

sip:
  # SIP address of the caller (i.e. the door bell)
  caller: "sip:doorbell@192.168.1.1"

  # SIP address of the callee (i.e. some internal phone number to ring)
  callee: "sip:**1@192.168.1.1"

  # Max. duration to keep the phone ringing
  maxRingingTime: 15s

  server:
    # The SIP host (your phone router)
    host: "192.168.1.1"
    # The SIP port (should be 5060 by default)
    port: 5060
    # The SIP user name to authenticate with
    user: user
    # The SIP password to authenticate with
    password: password
    # Whether to dump protocol logs
    debug: false

# Config for the status LED
statusLed:
  # GPIO number (not the physical pin) to connect
  gpio: 18
  # Duration to blink the status LED when a bell push is pressed
  blinkDuration: 10s

# External bell is anything that can be switched on and off
externalBell:
  # GPIO number (not the physical pin) to connect
  gpio: 25
  # Duration to ring the external bell (keep the relay open) when a bell push is pressed
  ringDuration: 2s

# Defines the individual bell pushes the system should react on
bellPushes:
  - label: Main door
    # Each bell push has its own GPIO number (not physical pin) to read state from
    gpio: 23
  - label: Secondary Door
    # Each bell push has its own GPIO number (not physical pin) to read state from
    gpio: 24

logging:
  # target defines where to write logs: stdout or syslog
  target: syslog

  # Whether to output debugging information (i.e. SIP protocol dumps)
  debug: false

controller:
  # Defines the path of the Unix socket to listen on for controller commands.
  socket: /var/run/raspidoor.socket

# Disable GPIP - useful for testing on non raspi.
